# Chronological-Photometry-Analysis-Pipeline
This repository contains a Python script for batch analysis of long-term fiber photometry data. The pipeline performs tdTomato-based regression correction, signal detrending, Z-score normalization, ΔF/F calculation, and peak/AUC quantification, and outputs summary tables and figures for defined time blocks.
